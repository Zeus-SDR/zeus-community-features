# Required repository settings

`main` is the protected review and publication boundary. Configure a GitHub
ruleset for `refs/heads/main` with pull requests, one code-owner approval for
outside contributions, stale-review dismissal, resolved conversations, strict
required Actions checks, and blocked force-push/deletion.

Require the exact `Trusted community submission policy` check after that
workflow exists on `main`, in addition to the schema, package, and platform
build checks. This protected-main check is the merge boundary that prevents an
outside listing pull request from changing tools or policy. Do not add it as a
required context before its workflow has landed, because the workflow cannot
run on the pull request that first introduces it.

Set default workflow-token permissions to read-only. Keep `@Kb2uka` and
`@iamexemplar` as explicit bypass actors so either maintainer retains
independent authority for their own work.

Never attach self-hosted runners to this public repository and never use
`pull_request_target` to check out or execute contributor content. Future CDN
credentials belong in a protected post-merge environment whose job does not
execute feature code.

Enable **immutable releases** for the repository before taking custody of any
package. The custody workflow checks this setting before upload and requires
the published release itself to report as immutable before it succeeds. Do not
disable the setting while any community package is published. The publishing
job also verifies GitHub's release attestation and asset digest before it
reports success.
